\usage{
grolenage_boot(
  param,
  method = "LSM",
  Linf_est = NA,
  Linf_init = 100,
  K_init = 0.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{param}{a \code{list} (or \code{data.frame}) consisting of following
parameters (levels/columns):
\itemize{
  \item \strong{age}: age measurements (e.g. from otoliths),
  \item \strong{length}: corresponding length measurements.
}}

\item{method}{indicating which of following methods should be applied:
\code{"GullandHolt"}, \code{"FordWalford"}, \code{"Chapman"},
\code{"BertalanffyPlot"}, or \code{"LSM"} (it corresponds to the non-linear
least squares fitting method, and is the default, which is recommended for
bootstrapping growth).}

\item{Linf_est}{BertalanffyPlot requires an estimate for \eqn{L_{inf}} to
derive \eqn{K} and \eqn{t_0} (for more information see Details).}

\item{Linf_init}{initital parameter of \eqn{L_{inf}} for non-linear sqaures
fitting (default 100).}

\item{K_init}{initital parameter of \eqn{K} for non-linear sqaures fitting
(default 0.1).}

\item{t0_init}{initital parameter of \eqn{L_0} for non-linear squares fitting
(default 0).}

\item{seed}{seed value for random number reproducibility (if it \code{NULL}
by default, it will set internally as \code{seed = as.numeric(Sys.time())}).}

\item{nresamp}{\code{numeric}; the number of permutations to run (Default:
\code{nresamp = 200}).}

\item{nan_action}{\code{character} that defines the action that the function
will execute if there is a row with \code{NaN} (growth rate parameters
inestimable for that resample):
\itemize{
 \item \code{nothing}: the function will return the results including the
 \code{NaN}s (default).
 \item \code{nanrm} or \code{narm}: after having the results, it will only
 returns the rows without \code{NaN}s. For this case \code{narm} and
 \code{nanrm} are equivalent, but it should be noted that the function will
 look for and omit the \code{NaN}s (and not the \code{NA}s). See Details.
 \item \code{force}: The function will start an iterative process changing
 the internal \code{seed} values until it fulfills the \code{nresamp}. It
 only works together with the \code{time_lim} argument. See Details.
}}

\item{time_lim}{If \code{nan_action = "force"}, it defines the maximum time
(in seconds) that the function will last resampling until it achieves a
result output with no-\code{NaN} rows.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{lfqBoot} containing 2 levels:
\describe{
  \item{\code{$bootRaw}}{A \code{data.frame} of fitted VBGF parameters
  (columns) by resampling (rows).}
  \item{\code{$seed}}{A \code{numeric} vector of seed values set prior to each
  resampling call.}
}
}
\description{
This function performs growth parameters from length-at-age data.
Since it internally uses the function \link[TropFishR]{growth_length_age},
this function allows to perform different methods: Gulland and Holt, Ford
Walford, Chapman, Bertalanffy, or non linear least squares method (LSM).

This function performs bootstrapped fitting of the von Bertalanffy growth
function with estimated growth parameters (\eqn{L_{inf}}, \eqn{K} and
\eqn{t_0}) from length-at-age data, based on the function
\link[TropFishR]{growth_length_age}. The output is an object containing the
parameters \eqn{L_{inf}}, \eqn{K} and \eqn{t_0} (named here \code{t_anchor})
as well as the growth performance index \eqn{Phiâ€™} (named \code{PhiL}).
}
\details{
It is important to take into account the particular considerations of each
method regarding the required parameters, so it is recommended to read the
Details of the documentation of \link[TropFishR]{growth_length_age}.

CI and plotting arguments (of \link[TropFishR]{growth_length_age}) are set as
\code{FALSE} for each bootstrap call here. By default,
\link[TropFishR]{growth_length_age} generates a plot when it is called, so
internally \code{grolenage_boot} executes a \code{dev.off} call in order to
prevent it.

\code{nan_action = "force"} should be used carefully, as estimated \code{NaN}
VBGF parameter values are not always a result of bootstrap data selection
factors. Few resamples should first be tested with different \code{Linf_init},
\code{K_init} and \code{t0_init} values. No selection of the realistic initial
parameters may also result in \code{NaN} values being obtained. The search
time may depend on the size of the input set. For example, if you have many
thousands of individuals or if (in addition) the value of \code{nresamp} is
too high, it is possible that the function will take a long time before
obtaining complete results. Even though \code{time_lim} avoids falling into
an infinite loop by limiting the time used by this process to 5 minutes, this
value is referential and might be insufficient due to the factors mentioned
above.

\code{t_anchor} is the true \eqn{t_0} estimate in the case of true
length-at-age data, but it will only be available from "BertalanffyPlot" or
"LSM" methods. For the other methods, a vector of \code{NA}s will be returned
instead.
