Description: A suite of bootstrap-based models and tools for analyzing fish 
  stocks and aquatic populations. Designed for ecologists and fisheries 
  scientists, it supports data from length-frequency distributions, 
  tag-and-recapture studies, and hard structure readings (e.g., otoliths). 
  See Schwamborn et al., 2019 <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.12.001> 
  for background. The package includes functions for bootstrapped fitting of 
  growth curves and plotting.
